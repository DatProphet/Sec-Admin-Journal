## 🔐 **Security Recommendations**

1. **Network Security Group (NSG)**  
   ✅ Ensure inbound rules only allow trusted IPs to connect via SSH (port 22).  
   🔒 Add a rule for **port 9392** if you're using **OpenVAS**, and optionally **10000** for **Webmin** or similar tools.

2. **Public IP & Exposure**  
   🔄 Consider replacing the public IP with a **private IP + VPN connection** or putting the VM behind an **Application Gateway** with WAF enabled (especially if you're enabling web-based UIs like OpenVAS or Webmin).

3. **Enable Auto-Shutdown**  
   💰 This will **save costs** when the VM isn’t in use. Since it’s currently off, it’s recommended to enable it via the Azure Portal.

4. **Enable OS Guest Diagnostics**  
   📊 Optional, but helpful for monitoring performance and health if needed.

5. **Turn on System-Assigned Managed Identity**  
   If you’ll connect to Azure services from Kali (e.g., logging to a central workspace), enabling this helps with secure identity-based access.

## 🌐 **Optional Networking Enhancements**

- **Add Azure Bastion** for secure, browser-based SSH access—no public IP required.
- **Enable Accelerated Networking** (if supported)—it’s currently off.
- **Use NSG Logging** (via Network Watcher) to monitor unexpected traffic.
